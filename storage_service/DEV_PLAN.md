# Development Plan: Data Storage Service
This document outlines the development plan for the service responsible for consuming classified tweet data from a message queue and persisting it into a MongoDB database.

This plan breaks the project into manageable, sequential tasks.

## Module 1: Project Setup & Configuration
**Goal**: Create the project structure and ensure all configurations can be loaded correctly.

### Tasks:

[Day 1] Create the directory and file structure as outlined above.

[Day 1] Set up a Python virtual environment and create the requirements.txt file.

[Day 2] Implement the configuration loader in app/config.py using pydantic's BaseSettings for robust environment variable management.

[Day 2] Define the Pydantic model for a ClassifiedTweet in app/models.py.

Estimated Time: 2 Days

## Module 2: MongoDB Integration
**Goal**: Establish a reliable, asynchronous connection to MongoDB and implement the data insertion logic.

**Services to Use**: PyMongo, Motor?

Tasks:

[Day 3] Implement the MongoDB connection logic in app/database.py. The connection should be managed as a global resource, initialized on startup.

[Day 4] Create an insert_tweet function that takes a validated Pydantic model and inserts it into the configured MongoDB collection.

[Day 4] Add basic error handling for database connection and write operations.

Estimated Time: 2 Days

## Module 3: Message Consumer Implementation
**Goal**: Implement the logic to consume messages from both Redis and Kafka.

**Services to Use**: redis-py, aiokafka.

Tasks:

[Day 5] In app/consumer.py, implement the consume_from_redis function. This function will subscribe to the Redis channel and listen for messages in an async loop.

[Day 6] In the same file, implement the consume_from_kafka function. This will set up an AIOKafkaConsumer and listen for messages.

[Day 7] For each message received, the consumer logic should:

Deserialize the JSON string.

Validate the data using the ClassifiedTweet Pydantic model.

Call the insert_tweet function from the database module.

Include robust error handling for malformed messages (e.g., log the error and continue).

Estimated Time: 3 Days

## Module 4: Service Orchestration
**Goal**: Tie all the components together into a runnable application.

### Tasks:

[Day 8] In app/main.py, create a main run_service async function.

[Day 8] This function will first initialize the MongoDB connection.

[Day 8] It will then call the appropriate consumer function (consume_from_redis or consume_from_kafka) based on the CONSUMER_TYPE environment variable.

[Day 9] Implement graceful shutdown logic to ensure the database and consumer connections are closed properly when the service receives a termination signal (SIGINT, SIGTERM).
